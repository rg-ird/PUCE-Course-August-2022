    "The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment designed to hold runnable code, text, figures and equations. It is mostly used for progressive implementation of pipelines in the field of data science. We think that it is a neat tool for creating tutorials, guides and even lectures. Each cell in a Notebook document contains code that is run in a process called the Kernel, which can be interrupted and restarted anytime. The default Kernel is IPython, but other programming languages can be easily downloaded and installed."
